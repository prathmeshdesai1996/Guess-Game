Guessing Game

Introduction:
This is a basic python script to demonstrate function creating and user interaction with python in form of a guessing game.

Game Function : 
When the script is run, the game asks for a user input - 'A', 'B' or 'C' which are the 3 labels of the positions.
The game contains a shuffled list and one of the position in the list consists '1'
If the players input matched the position where there is '1', the game gives an output as 'Won', otherwise 'Lost'
